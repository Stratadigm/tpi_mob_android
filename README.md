##Entities

Names which end with "VO" are View Objects and their intention is only to hold minimal data that should be displayed and this data should be prepared to be shown easily (without additional complex business logic). It's made so as to make adapters more scalable, i.e. if an api interface changes, you will only need to change converters from DTO to VO
